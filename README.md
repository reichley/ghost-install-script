### Ghost Install Script
I put together a ghost install script and included supervisor so ghost starts on boot/reboot.

#### Prerequisites
* Grab a domain name (or keep it on localhost if you like).
* Boot up a **CLEAN** Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit machine.

>>> **WARNING! This script will overwrite/append current system configurations. Please ensure you're using a CLEAN install.**

* Download the install script.
* Enter ```chmod u+x (script)``` to make the script executable.
* Run the script. ```./(script)```
* Enter your domain name at the prompt.
* Wait a minute or so...and decide whether you want to reboot or not. ```'y' or 'n'```
